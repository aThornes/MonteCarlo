# MonteCarlo

Code created in c# for the Monte Carlo experiment

Each text file contains the neccessary code for each of the questions given in the C:01 lab script for the module 04202 
at the University of Hull. Part of the code has been adapted from code found in the appendix of the lab script. The
program uses the in-built random function which is used to generate all random numbers except for Q1.
